methods_long: "Negative binomial XGBoost model using region-level summaries of past weather (including variables like temperature, precipitation and humidity, among others) obtained from ERA5 and county-level population and age-sex distributions from the US Census as covariates. Weather covariates were included as lagged variables, and for selected covariates also as seasonal and/or annual summaries. This is similar to the XGBNBpwJ model but here a separate model was fit to each region."
